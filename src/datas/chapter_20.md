# Arrays and Slices

## Arrays

The type `[n]T` is an array of `n` values of type `T`.

```go

var a [10]int

```

An array's length is part of its type, so arrays cannot be resized.

Arrays do not need to be initialized explicitly; the zero value of
an array is a ready-to-use array whose elements are themselves zeroed.

**Go**â€™s arrays are values. An array variable denotes the entire array;
it is not a pointer to the first array element (as would be the case
in C). This means that when you assign or pass around an array value
you will make a copy of its contents.

An array literal can be specified like so:

```go

b := [2]string{"Penn", "Teller"}

```

Or, you can have the compiler count the array elements for you:

```go

b := [...]string{"Penn", "Teller"}

```

In both cases, the type of `b` is `[2]string`.

## Slices

An array has a fixed size. A slice, on the other hand, is a dynamically-sized,
flexible view into the elements of an array.

The type `[]T` is a slice with elements of type `T`.

A slice is formed by specifying two indices, a low and high bound, separated
by a colon:

```go

a[low : high]

```

This selects a half-open range which includes the first element, but excludes
the last one.

## Slice length and capacity

A slice has both a length and a capacity.

The length of a slice is the number of elements it contains.

The capacity of a slice is the number of elements in the underlying
array, counting from the first element in the slice.

The length and capacity of a slice `s` can be obtained using the
expressions `len(s)` and `cap(s)`.

The zero value of a slice is `nil`. The `len` and `cap` functions
will both return `0` for a `nil` slice.

## Dynamically sized arrays as slices

Slices can be created with the built-in `make` function.
The `make` function allocates a zeroed array and returns a slice that refers to that array:

```go

a := make([]int, 5)  // len(a)=5

```

To specify a capacity, pass a third argument to make:

```go

b := make([]int, 0, 5) // len(b)=0, cap(b)=5

b = b[:cap(b)] // len(b)=5, cap(b)=5
b = b[1:]      // len(b)=4, cap(b)=4

```

## Appending to a slice

It is common to append new elements to a slice, and so Go provides a built-in
`append` function.

```go

 var s []int // nil slice

 // append works on nil slices.
 s = append(s, 0)

 // The slice grows as needed.
 s = append(s, 1)

 // We can add more than one element at a time.
 s = append(s, 2, 3, 4)

```

If the backing array of s is too small to fit all the given values a bigger array
will be allocated. The returned slice will point to the newly allocated array.

## 2D Slices

Sometimes it's necessary to allocate a 2D slice, a situation that can arise when
processing scan lines of pixels, for instance. There are two ways to achieve this.

1. Allocate each slice independently;

2. Allocate a single array and point the individual slices into it.

Which to use depends on your application.

If the slices might grow or shrink, they should be allocated independently to avoid
overwriting the next line; if not, it can be more efficient to construct the object
with a single allocation.

```go

func independentAlloc(XSize, YSize int) [][]uint8 {
 // Allocate the top-level slice.
 picture := make([][]uint8, YSize) // One row per unit of y.

 // Loop over the rows, allocating the slice for each row.
 for i := range picture {
  picture[i] = make([]uint8, XSize)
 }
 
 return picture
}

func blocAlloc(XSize, YSize int) [][]uint8 {
 // Allocate the top-level slice, the same as before.
 picture := make([][]uint8, YSize) // One row per unit of y.
 
 // Allocate one large slice to hold all the pixels.
 pixels := make([]uint8, XSize*YSize) // Has type []uint8 even though picture is [][]uint8.
 
 // Loop over the rows, slicing each row from the front of the remaining pixels slice.
 for i := range picture {
  picture[i], pixels = pixels[:XSize], pixels[XSize:]
 }
 
 return picture
}


```
