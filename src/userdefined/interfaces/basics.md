# Basics

Go relies on interfaces to achieve polymorphism and code flexibility.
Instead of explicit class inheritance, Go uses interfaces to define
contracts for behavior. Any type that implements the methods defined in
an interface is said to implicitly satisfy that interface. This allows
different types to be used interchangeably as long as they adhere to
the specified interface.
